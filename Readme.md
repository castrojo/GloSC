# GloSC

GloSC or Global SteamController is a small set of tools that allows you to use your SteamController as a system wide XInput-controller alongside a system wide (borderless window) Steam overlay

All complete with **per application bindings and working rumble emulation.**

GloSC can also launch any of your favorite Games and directly add them to Steam, be it Win32 or UWP!

It is **the tool** to enjoy any Game that has trouble with Steam and/or *add extra functionality* to your SteamController

Play *UWP-Games*, use *Reshade / SweetFX*, *Origin* and *Uplay*-Games with **no hassle**

```
```

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

* **Q: The overlay isn't showing up!**

  A: The overlay only works for windowed or borderless windowed mode applications. Nothing much I can do here.
     This is even true for UWP-Games! While it's true that UWP doesn't run exclusive fullscreen, they don't run, strictly speaking, classical borderless window either
     
     Try running your games as borderless window
     
* **Q: Audio turns off when using this**

  A: ViGEm emulates a full X360-controller incl. peripherals
  
  Go to your windows sound mixer and reset you default playback device - It should be fixed, even for the next shortcut launches

* **Q: GloSC always creates four controllers**

  A: Enable Xbox360 controller rebinding in Steam! It's in the "Controller" section in the Steam Settings. 
  
* **Q: Some games (Gears of War 4, Forza Horizons 3) have odd double inputs with the bumper buttons and sticks**

  A: Enable Xbox360 controller rebinding in Steam! It's in the "Controller" section in the Steam Settings. 

* **Q: Multiple different controllers are not working**

  A: Will probably be fixed in the long run, for now we have to wait for a new ViGEm release.

* **Q: Hitting the Steam Button + RT to take a screenshot doesn't work**

  A: Another limitation that most likely won't be fixed, even if Steam would take a screenshot, you'd most likely get just a blank image

* **Q: UWP Games don't launch in foreground**

  A: For some reason trying to launch them in foreground stops them from launching entirely
  
     For now use alt+tab via Steam-chords
     
     This is currently being investigated
```
```

It is built using [Qt 5.9](https://www.qt.io/) and uses [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) for drawing the overlay

The system wide Xbox-Controller works via [ViGEm](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEm)

Appveyor builds fail since they have not yet made QT5.9 available on their platform!

**GloSC consists of:**
 
 * A main application ("GloSC") allowing you to create and configure new shortcuts or "SteamTargets" and automatically add them to Steam
 * The "GloSC-GameLauncher" which can launch Win32 and UWP games and mainly exists to work around dual overlays
 * The "SteamTarget" which does most of the magic - Showing the overlay to the user as well as talking to the ViGEm-driver for system wide Controller emulation
